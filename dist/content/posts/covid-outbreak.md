[here](/dashboard.html) is an interactive dashboard that you can play with.

Note that since the chart data, that is the full vega-lite specification, is fetched from [there](/combined.json), the page can take some time to load for the first time.

If you have a hard time selecting countries, click on the legend at the bottom-right to select another status ; then you should be able to select any country.

Full timeseries data from Google's mobility [reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) are now available at:
- [world dataset](/mobility/world.json.gz): countries + regions
- [US dataset](/mobility/us.json.gz): states + counties

Thanks to reddit user _typhoidisbad_ who made this possible by [sharing]() his code, to produce the dataset on US states and counties.

Full source code and website is available [here](https://github.com/horaceg/covid19-analysis).  
Check out the `mobility` folder for this specific work.
